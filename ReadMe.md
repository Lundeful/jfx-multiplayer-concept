# JavaFX Multiplayer Concept

This a project for testing the capabilities of running a JavaFX dedicated server multiplayer game. Right now the "game" is just each player controlling a ball with the mouse and seeing the positions of both players. The server module connects the two clients and transfers the position of the ball.

Can run locally or server and clients on separate hosts.
